### OlÃ¡ ðŸ‘‹


### Hello everyone,
  
As a lover of Japanese and nerd culture, I'm a beginner in the tech world, currently based in Recife-PE, Brazil. I've been working at the same company since I started my career, initially as a Supply Chain Analyst, and now as a Business Partner for IT. Recently, I began learning SQL and have been involved in several tasks, reports, and projects using T-SQL and Power BI.

I'm a shy person but love work in groups, and i love learn new things ans solve problens and puzzles.
