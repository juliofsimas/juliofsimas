### Hello everyone,

I'm a passionate enthusiast of both Japanese culture and the vibrant world of nerd culture. My journey into the tech realm is relatively recent, and I'm currently based in Recife, PE, Brazil. My career began at the same company where I've grown from a Supply Chain Analyst to my current role as a Business Partner within the IT department.

My journey into IT started with a fascination for SQL, and I've since been immersed in crafting reports, tackling complex problems, and finding creative solutions through this powerful tool.
